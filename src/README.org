  Those are the source files for the =scmin= -- /a basic Scheme interpreter/.

* lexer.c

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include "../include/lexer.h"	/* lexer header */

    vector_t *read_tokens(string_t);
    string_t stream_as_string(FILE *);
    vector_t *read_stream_tokens(FILE *);

  This file contains the functions that are responsible of converting a piece of text, i.e. the source code, whether it was from a =string_t= (=char *=) or from a stream (=FILE *=)


* parser.c

* repl.c
  using =eval()=, we evaluate the value of a sexpr, which give a result, /i.e. return/

  the way to do that is to determine the operator and the set of operands.


* gc.c

* vector.c

* main.c
